<h2>Who I Am</h2>

<p>My name is Lucas Laibly; I am currently student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying Computer Science, with a minor in Digital Communications. I want to work for a company that perpetuates creativity and authenticity. A company that looks at their employees as more than just worker bees, one which invests in them to develop their skills and become better professionals. One which trusts their employees to do quality work, and do it timely.</p>

<p>Understanding what I am looking for, the question arises: what do I bring the table? First off, my attitude. I have been told that I am a positive force to work with, with an electric personality. I do not want to be in toxic environment, and I certainly do not want to contribute to it. Secondly, leadership. Achieving the rank of Eagle taught me many things. One of these being the EDGE Method. EDGE stands for Educate, Demonstrate, Guide, and Enable. I apply this as often as possible as it allows for deep relationships and further understanding of content. Finally, my work ethic. I hate letting people down, and I hate not meeting expectations. I am proud of my work, but I always seek to do better.</p>

<p>Work is not all that I am about. What do I do in my free time? I love gaming. It is what originally got me into computers. Playing games with friends around the world is something that I love to do to pass time. Playing through stories, puzzles, and entertaining environments keeps me creative and continuously thinking. But while PC games are great, I am also an avid Dungeons and Dragons player. I love to roll the dice and slay mythical beasts in Dungeons and Dragons. I am both a Dungeon Master of my own group, as well as player. Outside of my apartment and away from my desktop, I enjoy mountain biking and scuba diving.</p>

<h2>Past and Present Projects</h2>
<p>The projects that I have done out of school.</p>
<hr>

<img src="img/cogburnt_crows_icon.PNG" class="left"/>
<h5 class="">CogBurnt Crows</h5>
<p>First coding expereince ever. Was completed while at DeftFlux. Simple mobile game for two people to play using the same device. Intention was to learn C# and Unity, as well as start thinking about game making as whole.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    
<hr>
<img src="img/adjace_icon.PNG" class ="right"/>
<h5 class="">Adjace.com</h5>
<p>Second coding project I helped with (partially). Product offered by DeftFlux, designed to simplify putting a customer's congregation into an online database. Enables particpants to have ease-of-access to other's information based on where that person ranks within the community (that way someone who just joined does not gain access to EVERYONE's information).</p>   
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
    
<img src="img/waldo_lowfid.PNG" class="left"/>
<h5 class="">Project Waldo</h5>
<p>A game I thought of, designed, and pitched to my room mates. We are now working on it, alpha can be expected to be live by the end of August. Project Waldo is an ARG, alternate reality game. Many gamer's (like myself) struggle to spend more time outside versus inside. Waldo looks to engage those people specifically. Each player makes their own character, then using Google Maps, they traverse the outside world and level up by completing quests made by other players. Each player has 6 traits that each affect the them differently. Are you up to quest IRL!?</p>
